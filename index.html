  Machine Learning in Prognostic Decision-Support Systems Study - Med Student Version
 </h1>
</head>
  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    Thank you for your interest in our study.</br>
    A primary role of doctors and clinicians is to assess the medical risk of patients exhibiting various symptoms and characteristics, and prescribe appropriate treatments and medical actions.<br/> 
    The purpose of the study is to investigate the factors that drive value for the use of <b>Machine Learning models</b> in generating prognostic predictions as part of <b>decision-support systems for risk assessment</b> designed to augment and complement the work of medical professionals and diagnosticians.<br/>
    Many risk scores are currently embedded in electronic electronic health records; however these are based on logic rules and simpler statistical methods rather than Machine Learning algorithms, which can provide increased accuracy and other benefits, but may have perceived limitations in areas such as interpretability.<br/>
    We are specifically looking to make Machine Learning algorithms more <i>transparent, explainable</i>, and <i>interpretable</i> by discovering how different model information and decision-support system design choices affect the confidence of medical experts in such systems.<br/>
    The study proceeds in two stages:
    <ol>
        <li><b>About the model</b>, which introduces and presents information regarding the <b>Neural Network</b> powering our Decision-Support System</li>
        <li><b>Decision Support</b>, which introduces a mock decision-support system designed to present predicted risk scores for patients</li>
    </ol> 
    
    In this study, we focus on patients who have experienced heart failure, and predict the probability, or risk, of death one year after their heart failure event.<br/><br/>

    <h5>General Information</h5>
    <p>Machine Learning, and more generally Artificial Intelligence, models are gaining enthusiasm for their ability to produce highly accurate predictive and analytical insights. However, as many such models, including neural networks, are <i>black-boxes</i>, many fields of practice are reluctant to utilise these models without an ability to interpret their results or understand how a model generates its prediction.</p>
    <p>As a result, although ML models appear like natural and powerful choices for powering systems that support and augment decision-making processes for medical clinicians, there has so far not been a heavy push to incorporate these into practice in the medical field.</p>
    <p>The aim of this study is to explore this phenomenon and understand what type of model evidence and interpretability modules will increase comprehension and the confidence levels for users in different machine learning predictive models utilised in decision-support systems for prognostics.</p>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>The model was trained using the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) data-set, which compiled patient data from 30 studies including both randomized clinical trials and observational registries.</p>
        <p>The data set included <b>30,389</b> patients who have experienced a <b>heart failure</b> event. Of these, 18.8% died within 1 year of experiencing heart failure.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b> that all risk scores reported are for patients who have <i>already</i> experienced heart failure.</p>
        <p>Of the 30,389 patients, 66% were male. The average age was 68, with a standard deviation of 12 years.</p>
        <p>31 patient characteristics, symptoms, and other features were collected, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Basic patient details</b>: Age, gender, ethnicity</li>
            <li><b>Patient habits</b>: BMI, Smoking, Diabetes condition</li>
            <li><b>Physical symptoms</b>: Shortness of breath (at rest and exercise), rales</li>
            <li><b>Relevant prescriptions</b>: ACE inhibitors/ARB, Beta blockers</li>
            <li><b>Data and test results</b>: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ejection fraction, etc.</li>

            <h3>Model Training and Implementation</h3>
            <p>The model utilised was a Neural Network, a sophisticated deep learning algorithm that has seen increased attention in recent years, as multiple studies have shown it to vastly outperform simpler linear models and other methods that have been traditionally utilised to generate risk scores in medicine.</p>
            <p>A <b>neural network</b> is a Machine Learning algorithm inspired by the human brain, utilising <b>connected nodes</b> organised in <b>hidden layers</b>. With a single node and layer, the network would be essentially equivalent to a the linear predictive model known as Logistic Regression. However, adding nodes and layers enables the network to learn more complex, non-linear patterns in the data.</p><p>The network uses optimization techniques and non-linear activation functions to automatically discover these complex patterns and learn how to make predictions from data. You can find more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Below is a generic image of a neural network by Machine Learning expert <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html" target="_blank">Michael Nielsen</a>:</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="NN.png" style="width:500px;"></p>
            <p>The network takes in a large amount of data, in the form of patient characteristics or features, and outputs the probability of a patient dying within 1 year of a heart failure event.</p>
            <p>The Neural Network we utilised contained 2 hidden layers of 100 and 20 nodes respectively. In general, as explained <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#the_architecture_of_neural_networks" target="_blank">here</a>, network architecture, including the number of nodes and layers, must be tweaked and tuned to ensure the network is large enough to capture complex data patterns, but not too large compared to the size of the data-set, which would result in over-fitting and poor predictive performance in practice. The architecture we have selected of 2 layers with 100 and 20 nodes, respectively, was tuned and found to achieve highly accurate results.</p>
            <p>The model was trained using 10-fold cross validation, using 90% of the data for training and the rest for testing. This was repeated 10 times, and we report average figures over the run.

            <h3>Model Accuracy</h3>
            <p>The neural network showcases <b>81.26%</b> accuracy, which means that 81% of the test cases were classified correctly by the model.</p>
            <p>The model's AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating curve), which is equal to the C-Index, is <b>0.725</b>, with a standard deviation of 0.0054, averaged over 10 runs. This suggests high accuracy for the type of data, as we demonstrate below by comparing our network to a simple linear model and a risk score currently in use. For more information on the C-Statistic or AUC-ROC, <a href="http://www.statisticshowto.com/c-statistic/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
            <p>The model's ROC curve is below:</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="NNROC.png" style="width:350px;"></p>
            <p>In addition, the model achieves an AUC-PR (area under the precision recall curve) of <b>0.376</b>. For more information about precision and recall, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
            <p>The neural network's accuracy values for both AUC-ROC and AUC-PR are much higher than the best linear regression model trained on the same data. They are also significantly higher than the accuracy of the MAGGIC Risk Score, an accepted risk score trained on the same data and developed by the European Society of Cardiology and other researchers.

            <h3>Model Interpretation: Stratified Linear Approximation</h3>
            <p>We have trained a neural network to predict the <b>risk</b>, or probability that a given patient who has suffered heart failure will die within one year of the heart failure event.</p>
            <p>The model was trained on the data-set discussed previously, containing over 30K patients and 31 patient characteristics and features ranging from age to their New York Heart Association Score.</p>
            <p>As shown previously, the neural-network outperforms simple linear models. However, the network is a <b>black-box</b>, which means it is impossible to tell how patient characteristics contribute to the outputted risk scores it produces.</p>
            <p>In order to better understand how the model produces a prediction, black-box models, like neural networks, can be <b>approximated locally</b> using simpler models, including linear regression models.</p>
            <p>To create local approximations, after the neural network generated its risk scores, a different linear model was trained for each quintile of risk: 0-20%, 20-40%, etc.</p>
            <p>The Root Mean-Squared Error between the neural network model and the linear approximation is 0.036, suggesting the 2 models are very close.</p>
            <p>Below is a summary of the coefficients for each local linear model:</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="NNSLIM.png" style="width:600px;"></p>
            <p>Since the linear approximation and the neural network models are so close, the value of each characteristic’s coefficient closely approximates their contribution to the variability in predicted patient risk score.</p>
            <p>For instance, the negative coefficient for Beta blocker prescriptions suggests a negative correlation between this variable and risk of death, though the magnitude differs among risk strata. Some factors, such as shortness of breath at rest or gender, are only significant for high risk groups.</p>

    <h2><b>Part 2</b>: Decision Support System Providing Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>We next focus on a <b>Decision Support System providing Risk Assessment</b>. Such a system is designed to support the decision-making processes of doctors facing patients exhibiting certain characteristics, symptoms, and conditions.<p/><p>The system supports decisions on relevant medical actions by providing a <b>predicted risk score</b>, as well as background and explanations of the score.<br/>The system does <b>not</b> make treatment recommendations. However, the information provided may assist treatment decisions by explaining how different patient risk factors may contribute to predicted outcomes.</p>
        <p>The following diagram explains the purpose and workings of a Decision Support System (DSS) powered by the Neural Network method described in Part 1:</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="DSSDiagram.png" style="width:850px;"></p>
        <p>Note that the DSS is based on the Neural Network trained on data of over 30,000 patients. As new patients consult with their doctors, the clinician may refer to the decision-support system. The DSS will produce a predicted risk score based on the patient's characteristics, and may additionally output relevant local, high-interpretable linear or decision-tree models. The information produced may be utilised by a clinician to inform medical actions and impact patient outcomes.</p><br/>
        <p>Starting on the next screen, you will be presented with a series of patients.</p>
        <p>Note that these patients were <i>not</i> part of the model's training set, and have been selected <i>at random.</i></p>
        <p>Each patient will be accompanied by a risk score generated using the Neural Network model discussed previously. In addition, medical information about the individual patients will be presented as well.</p>
        <p>Please evaluate this information, and rate your satisfaction with the model and the Decision Support System as a whole.</p>
